# Summary

Worry is a psychological effect which we can control. Cultivate a mental
attitude of peace and happiness, be yourself and don’t stress the little
things. Think ‘what is the worst thing that could happen?’ and accept
outcomes you can’t influence, including past events. Most worries come
from not knowing enough to make a decision; identify the root of the
problem and once you have decided what to do, **act** and be confident
in your decision. Keep busy, help others and you’ll find a purpose to
drive you.

# Understanding the nature of worry

1.  Live in day-tight compartments
2.  When faced with a problem, ask yourself ‘what is the worst thing
    that could happen?’

# Analysing worry

1.  Most worries come from not knowing enough to be confident in a
    decision
2.  Once you’ve made a decision, act upon it and don’t worry
3.  When faced with a problem, ask:
    -   What is the problem?
    -   What is the *cause* of the problem?
    -   What are all the possible solutions?
    -   What is the *best* solution?

# How to break the habit of worrying

1.  Keeping busy clears your mind of worry
2.  Don’t worry about little problems; don’t let them affect your
    happiness
3.  Bear in mind that many worries are statistically very unlikely to
    occur
4.  Accept outcomes we can’t influence
5.  Forgive and forget conflicts of the past; what’s done is done

# Stop worrying about criticism

1.  Unjust criticism is often a disguised compliment
    -   It often means you have aroused jealousy and envy
2.  Do the very best you can; nobody can ask for any more than that
3.  Be comfortable with critiquing yourself
    -   Being self-deprecating is an important hallmark of a leader

# Cultivate a mental attitude that brings you peace and happiness

1.  Fill your mind with thoughts of peace, courage, health and hope
    -   “our life is what our thoughts make of it”
2.  Don’t worry about trying to *get even* with people
    -   Hating our enemies gives them power over us, and our happiness
3.  Don’t imitate others; find yourself and be yourself
4.  When something bad happens, look for the benefits it could bring
5.  We forget our own unhappiness when we create a little happiness for
    others

# Prevent worry and fatigue

1.  Rest *before* you get tired
2.  Learn to relax at work and at home
3.  Follow these working habits
    -   Clear your desk of all papers except those relating to the problem
        at hand
    -   Do things in order of their importance
    -   Don’t put off problems, try and solve them there and then
    -   Learn to organise, deputise and supervise
4.  Prevent worry and fatigue by putting enthusiasm into your work
