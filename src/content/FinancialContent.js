Saving early is essential for maximising growth. Equity markets have
consistently delivered the best returns, and investing in index fund
ETFs and international markets provide good growth and spread risk.

1. Before you start saving, focus on clearing personal debts you have
    -   Credit cards and other debts with high interest rates should always be tackled before you look to invest.
2. Make sure you have an emergency fund
    -   Unexpected things happen - pandemics, recessions, medical emergencies - so it pays to save 2-3 times your
        typical monthly expenses before you start saving
3. By investing our money, we can take advantage of the power of compound interest
    -   £1 invested in equities today could be worth £15 by retirement in 40 years
    -   If one waited 10 years to start investing, it would be worth only £7.50 (30 years)
    -   This is the equivalent of 9.5%pa
4. A recipe for investment
    -   **Go global** – many investors miss out on good opportunities by
        only investing in domestic stocks. Developing countries have massive
        growing consumer demand and untapped natural resources. Investing
        globally also offers a hedge against a weakening domestic currency
        (Brexit!)
    -   **Be diversified** – buying index funds are a great way to begin and
        ensures a broad portfolio
    -   **Get out of your own way** – don’t be an emotional investor; be
        hands-off and automate deposits to ISAs to ensure you are saving
        adequate amounts
