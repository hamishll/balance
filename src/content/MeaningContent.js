# Summary

1. He who has a *why* can bear almost any *how*

The ultimate freedom we all have, is the ability to choose one's attitude
in any situation. Even those who have suffered greatly have it within
themselves to find meaning, and from that meaning we can find happiness.

We can find meaning through:
- Creating a work or doing a deed 
- Experiencing something or someone (love) 
- The attitude we take towards unavoidable suffering

We shouldn't aim for a tensionless state but rather the striving and 
struggling of pursuing a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.


# A case for hope in any circumstance

Even those in desperate situations have reason to hope. Health, family,
happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society - so long
as we're alive, all these things can be achieved again or resored.

If everything is taken away from us, what alone remains is **the 
ability to choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances**.
This ultimate freedom was recognised by the Stoics.

*The salvation of man is through love and in love*. A man who has
nothing left in this world may still know bliss, be it only for a
brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.

Even things that we can't recover will always be with us. **What you have
experienced, no power on earth can take away from you.**

In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost but everything irretrievably
stored. We are always making a choice - which poteniality will be 
condemned to nonbeing and which will be actualised? Which will be made
an actuality and stored in time forever?

**Do not pity the old - whilst they have few possibilities in the future,
they have a wealth of realities saved in the past.** If we make the most of the
time we have then we can look back on a rich collection of memories we have
stored.

Our society tends to value humans based on their usefulness, however the
elderly have an unconditional value and dignity in their past actions that
we should also value.

# Finding meaning in suffering

Imagine you lose the one you love. Such an event may be a cause of serious
depression. However one can find meaning in this unavoidable suffering - for
such a suffering has been spared our loved one, who would have mourned us had
we been lost to them.  In some way, **suffering ceases to be suffering at the
moment it finds a meaning**, such as the meaning of sacrifice.

Consider also people with significant disabilities who can still find happiness; 
many of which report that the misfortunate that befell them has made them more 
grateful of their life and report that the suffering helped them grow.

# Don't chase 'happiness'

Our current popular culture stresses the idea that we ought to be
happy, which can leave us feeling frustrated and ashamed of not being happy. 

1. **Happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. One must have a *reason* to be happy.**

We're not in pursuit of happiness, but rather in search of a *reason* to become happy.

If you want someone to laugh you need to give them a *reason*, e.g. telling a joke.

Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension 
between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to 
accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should
become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore
is indispensible to mental well-being. **What man actually needs is 
not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling of
a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task**.

# The nature of suffering

Our suffering is similar to the behaviour of a gas - a specific
quantity of gas will fill a chamber completely and evenly, no matter
the size of the chamber. **Similarly, our suffering fills the mind, 
no matter whether the suffering is great or small**.



# The existensial vacuum

The existential vacuum is a widespread phenomenon of the twentieth
century. This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which
man has had to undergo since he became a truly human being.
First, we lost some basic animal instincts in which our being was secured.
Secondly, the traditions and constraints which enforced our behaviour are 
now rapidly diminishing. Thus, **no instinct tells us what to do and no
tradition tells us what we ought to do**. 

This manifests itself primarily as a state of boredom. If we can find 
*meaning* in our lives we can counteract this existential vacuum.

# The meaning of life

Just as in chess, there is no one "best" move, only the best move 
for a given situation. The same holds true for human existence. One
should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has their
own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete 
assignment which demands fulfillment.

**Being human always points to something or someone other than oneself**.
The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or
another person to love - the more human he is and the more he actualises 
himself. 

# Three forms of meaning in life

We can find meaning in three aspects of our life:
- Creating a work or doing a deed 
- Experiencing something or someone (love) 
- The attitude we take towards unavoidable suffering

A human being is not one thing among others; *things* determine each other, 
but *man* is ultimately self-determining. What we become (within the constraints
of our environment) we have made of ourselves. Subject to the same conditions, 
some of us will behave terribly, and some will behave as saints - both 
potentialities exist within us.

Live as if you were living already for the second time. In your previous
you may have acted wrongly but this is your chance to act correctly. In 
doing this we imagine trhat the present is past, but that it may yet be
changed. This confronts us with life's *finiteness* as well as its *finality*.
We should identify what are the responsibilities in our life, and do the
right thing to uphold those responsibilities.
